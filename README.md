# SPAD-optimisation

## Introduction
As part of my engineering studies at Telecom Physique Strasbourg, I'm doing a 3-month placement at VTEC Lasers and sensors in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. As I specialise in quantum science and technology, my internship subject is single-photon detector technology, which is useful in the field of quantum photonics.

Single-photon detectors for the near-infrared wavelength region, such as single-photon
avalanche diodes (SPADs), are receiving increasing interest in a growing number
of photon counting applications, including, for example, quantum cryptography and computing, 3-D laser ranging (LIDAR), optical VLSI circuit inspection, time-resolved spectroscopy, etc. InGaAs/InP SPADs are used for single-photon counting and photon timing, typically at 1550 nm.

## Goals
The aim is to simulate and then optimise, using machine learning techniques, the efficiency of a SPAD detector. This optimisation involves calculating the photodetection efficiency (PDE) and the dark count rate (DCR). These two parameters depend on the thickness and doping concentration of the various semiconductor layers making up the SPAD.

## PDE
This parameter depends on the avalanche trigerring and photon absorption probabilities.
